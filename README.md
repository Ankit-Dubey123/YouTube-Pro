- Debouncing in React is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function gets executed.
  - How Debouncing Works
    - Event Trigger: An event (like typing in a search box) triggers a function call.
    - Delay Execution: The function's execution is delayed by a specified time interval.
    - Reset Timer: If the event is triggered again before the time interval elapses, the timer is reset.
    - Execute Function: The function is only executed if the event is not triggered again within the specified time interval.
